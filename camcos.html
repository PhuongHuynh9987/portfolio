        <section>
            <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
            <p> <span class = 'span'> </span> This project is a part of the CAMCOS (Center for Applied Mathematics, 
                Computation and Statistics) course offered by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics 
                at San Jose State University. <br>
                
                <span class = 'span'> </span>  In this project, we are divided into two teams, a data and a theory 
                team. While data team gathers data from BlockNative and performs data analysis and manipulation,
                theory team uses the information in addition to throughout researches about Ethereum blockchain system
                to analyze a possible solution, a forward inclusion list (FIL) design, imposed for censorship resistance. While
                the main project can be found <a href="https://github.com/krzhang/camcos/tree/main/CAMCOS_2023F/Data_Exploration" target="_blank">here</a>, 
                I have put together a side analysis myself to find important insights that could help me with the research.

            <h2> II. Data Aggregating</h2>
            <p><span class = 'span'> </span> Firstly, I included the data in four days, September 4, 5 ,6, and 7. Then, 
            I combined them as a same csv file.</p>
